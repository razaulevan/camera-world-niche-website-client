GoPro, Inc.[2] (marketed as GoPro and sometimes stylized as GoPRO) is an American technology company founded in 2002 by Nick Woodman. It manufactures action cameras and develops its own mobile apps and video-editing software. Founded as Woodman Labs, Inc, the company eventually focused on the connected sports genre, developing its line of action cameras and, later, video editing software. It is based in San Mateo, California.

It developed a quadcopter drone, Karma, released in October 2016. In January 2018, Karma was discontinued and the company hired JPMorgan Chase to pursue options of selling the company.[3] However, a month later, the CEO denied this. GoPro has continued its business in manufacturing action cameras.[4]

History:
The company was founded by Nick Woodman in 2002.[5] He was motivated by a 2002 surfing trip to Australia in which he was hoping to capture high quality action photos, but could not because amateur photographers could not get close enough or buy appropriate quality equipment at reasonable prices.[6] The 'GoPro' name came about as Woodman and his surfing friends all aspired to become professional surfers as 'going pro' was the ultimate goal and the only way to be filmed on the water at that time.[7][8][9] The camera range was branded 'Hero' as their aim was to capture close-up action shots that made the subject look like a hero.[7] Woodman raised a portion of his initial capital by selling bead and shell belts for under US$20 from his VW van[10] and, later, fashionable camera straps. He also received over $230,000 from his parents to invest in the business.[11][12]

Corporate actions:
On March 30, 2011, GoPro acquired CineForm. The acquisition included the CineForm 444 video codec used in the film Slumdog Millionaire. The company claimed that the codec "makes HD and 3D editing faster and more convenient without sacrificing image quality". It was incorporated in the company's 3D Hero System shortly after the acquisition.[22][23]

In March 2013, GoPro issued a DMCA takedown notice to website DigitalRev.com, which had posted a review[24] of its product, citing trademark use as a breach of copyright. This notice was retracted 10 days later, citing "erroneous enforcement".[25][26]

On April 28, 2015, GoPro acquired Kolor, a spherical media and virtual reality startup based in Chambéry, France.[27] Kolor were developers of Autopano, Autopano Video and Panotour. After September 14, 2018, Kolor products will no longer be for sale and Kolor products would no longer receive updates.[28]

On February 29, 2016, GoPro spent $105 million and acquired two start-ups—Stupeflix and Vemory—for their video editing tools Replay and Splice.[29][30]

In March 2020, GoPro acquired stabilization software company, ReelSteady.[31]

HERO cameras:
Woodman worked on his first camera for two years after founding the company, eventually introducing the GoPro 35mm HERO in September 2004 at San Diego's Action Sports Retailer trade show.[39] In its first year GoPro sold $150,000 worth of products.[39] In 2006 the company introduced its first Digital HERO, with 10 second video capability, and generated $800,000 in revenue. The following year GoPro sales quadrupled to $3.4 million.[39]

In 2014, the company was selling the HERO3+ in editions of different colors. It was capable of filming in 16:9 aspect ratio, supporting 4K UHD video and 12 MP still photographs.[40] The HERO4 was introduced on September 24, 2014.[41]

On September 28, 2017, GoPro released the HERO6 Black, which claims improved stabilization over the HERO5 models and is capable of capturing 4K video in 60 FPS.

On September 20, 2018, GoPro came out with the HERO7 Black, which apart from providing improved stabilization over HERO6 models with HyperSmooth, also featured the new form of video capturing, "TimeWarp", providing a high speed effect to the videos. HERO7 also came out with capability to stream live across multiple platforms like facebook and Youtube .

On July 11, 2018, GoPro announced that it had sold more than 30 million HERO cameras since inception.
